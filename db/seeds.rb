because a smile a day keep the haters away.\n
Now go and be great today :)")

imperfectly_beautiful = Affirmation.create(kind: 'poem', mood: 'love', title: 'Imperfectly Beautiful', content: "Imperfectly Beautiful\n
\n
If I close my eyes i can still see you.\n
Your energy is magnetic,\n
and your heart illuminates mine.\n
You're so beautiful, let me tell you how:\n
It's everything you think but some of the things maybe you don't know. \n
Have you ever just took a look at nature and got lost in a gaze?\n
Think of how you feel and the mood it puts you in;\n
I love your natural,\n
The moments when you are just being unapologetically you.\n
You need nothing to enhance your beauty;\n
Because I can see it with my eyes closed.\n
Stay just the way you are.\n
Dreams turned reality." )

two_am = Affirmation.create(kind: 'poem', mood: 'love', title: '2am.', content: "2am.\n
\n
üëÇüèæ what do you hear.\n
I love you.\n
I know i don't tell you enough.\n
I see you shining daily.\n
I rarely acknowledge it but you are great.\n
You are my inspiration because you meet goals.\n
But i don't tell you enough.\n
You are humble but your actions speak for itself." )

###Encouragement

reality_of_it_all = Affirmation.create(kind: 'poem', mood: 'encouragement', title: '.Reality of It All', content: ".Reality of It All\n
\n
There is no guarantee that being yourself will get you liked,\n
that going hard will get you paid,\n
or\n
that anything you experience will make sense.\n
But there is a starting point for it all;\n
and a narrative that can constantly change.\n
Captain this ship, there are places to go, things to do.\n
Who else would you rather be?\n
This moment should be nostalgic;\n
because this isn‚Äôt the first and won‚Äôt be the last.\n
A new quest begins again.\n
Sometimes you have to just let people know that you are here and you don‚Äôt care what they think.\n
Some people find creativity in lanes other people might not.\n
People always remember what they see last,\n
might as well give it your best." )

six_again = Affirmation.create(kind: 'poem', mood: 'encouragement', title: '6 again. ', content: "6 again.\n
\n
Dream as if you were a kid again.\n
Free from the judge, the cruel, the rule and all of the stereotypes.\n
Dream as if you could fall and get back up and nobody would criticize you for learning how to be better.\n
From all the hate, the judge and all the negative self reflection.\n
Dream as if anything was possible and you could steer the ship as the pilot to your own destination; from all the pressure, pain, and disappointment.\n
Everything you are running from is due to fear finding it way to the surface.\n
From your passions, your dreams and potential.\n
Dream as if you were a kid again, because then the possibilities are endless.\n
Not from what you are running from, but life.\n
Life is more amazing when we can control what we are running towards.\n
\n
Dream like a kid again.")

wildest_dreams = Affirmation.create(kind: 'poem', mood: 'encouragement', title: 'Wildest Dreams', content: "Wildest Dreams\n
\n
What if you could live your wildest dreams?\n
And could be who you really want to be?\n
Imagine for a second your dream in real life.\n
How would you move?\n
What would you think?\n
It is like you're seeing yourself become who you desire to be.\n
Know you can be.\n
Then come back to reality and recreate what you imagined.\n
Can you remember what it looked like?\n
Could you describe how it felt?\n
I am sure you were void of fear.\n
I am sure you were phased by no judgement.\n
I am sure you overcame every obstacle; no limitations.\n
\n
The wildest of dreams have no boundaries;\n
but they are imagined and recreated many times before they become reality.\n
\n
-dreamer")
